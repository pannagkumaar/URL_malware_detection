The Intelligent URL Security Analyzer is a versatile Python script designed to analyze URLs for potential security risks, malicious activities, and other anomalies. It incorporates various features such as VirusTotal and URLScan scans, machine learning-based predictions, typosquatting checks, and detailed URL analysis.

## Features

### 1. VirusTotal Scan
- Utilizes the [VirusTotal API](https://www.virustotal.com/) for a comprehensive scan of the given URL.
- Retrieves information about the number of security vendors flagging the URL as malicious.
- Provides detailed insights into the verdict, overall score, and malicious status.

### 2. URLScan Scan
- Leverages the [URLScan API](https://urlscan.io/) to submit and scan the URL for potential threats.
- Displays a detailed report including overall score, malicious status, and additional details.
- Supports comprehensive analysis of brands associated with the URL.

### 3. Abuse IP DB Check
- Utilizes the [Abuse IP DB API](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) to check if the IP address associated with the given URL has been reported for abusive behavior.
- Displays the total number of reports, the number of distinct users reporting, and the confidence of abuse.
- Provides detailed information about the reports, including the reporter's information and the report categories.
- Enhances security by identifying potentially malicious IP addresses reported by the community.
  

### 4. Machine Learning Prediction
- Employs machine learning using a logistic regression model for predicting URL maliciousness.
- Integrates TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- Trained on a curated dataset to enhance accuracy.

### 5. URL Analysis
- Performs a thorough analysis of the given URL covering various aspects:
  - Structure analysis for detecting anomalies.
  - Typosquatting checks to identify potential malicious URLs.
  - Phishing keyword analysis to detect malicious intent.
  - IP address detection and non-standard port checks.
  - Unusual URL structure analysis for enhanced security.

### 6. Redirection Analysis
- Analyzes URL redirections to provide insights into the redirection chain.
- Displays status codes, IP addresses, and countries associated with each redirection.
- Aids in identifying potential security risks related to redirections.

### 7. HTTPS Anomalies Check
- Verifies SSL certificates associated with the URL.
- Checks for common name matching, expiration dates, and trusted certificate authorities.
- Enhances security by identifying potential anomalies in HTTPS usage.

### 8. Dynamic Parameter Analysis
- Analyzes dynamic parameters in the URL to identify potential security risks.
- Detects numeric values, suspicious characters, SQL injection patterns, and XSS vulnerabilities.
- Enhances security by scrutinizing URL parameters for potential threats.

## Usage

To analyze a URL, you can either build your own model using the dataset 
  1. Run the ipynb file in the Model folder to create the model
  

  2. Create a .env file and load it with these
  ```bash
   # Insert your VirusTotal API key
VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY=your_virus_total_api_key

# Insert your URLScan API key
URLSCAN_API_KEY=your_urlscan_api_key

# Insert your AbuseIP API key
ABUSEIP_API_KEY=your_abuseip_api_key
```
3. Then run the code to check the URL
```bash
python url.python
```
4. And then enter the URL that you want to scan 
```bash
Enter the URL that you want to check: www.example.com
